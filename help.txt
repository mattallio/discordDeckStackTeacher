Each of the following commands will make the bot send a random card and after 5 seconds the number of the card relative to the stack selected:
.memorandum
.mnemonica 
.daortiz 
.redford 
.aronson 

If you create specific channels named: "memorandum-stack", "mnemonica-stack", "daortiz-stack", "redford-stack", "aronson-stack"
you can use the command .t to train your memory: the bot will send a random card and after 5 seconds the number of the card in the stack relative to the channel name
